# Code Examples

This directory contains code examples that serve as patterns and templates for the AI assistant.

## Purpose
The files in this directory are **critical** for ensuring the AI generates code that aligns with our project's architecture, style, and conventions. The AI is instructed to study these examples before writing any new code.

## What to Include
- **`database_connection.py`**: Example of how to connect to the database.
- **`api_client.py`**: Pattern for making requests to external APIs.
- **`test_pattern.py`**: A sample test file showing how to structure unit tests with Pytest.
- **`module_structure/`**: A directory showing the desired structure for a typical feature module.

Please add or modify examples to reflect the best practices for this specific project.
